        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <h4>Mochi</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>shiratamako (glutinous rice flour/sweet rice flour) <strong>or</strong> mochiko â€“ I prefer to use shiratamako as it yields a better texture. However, I understand that mochiko is more affordable and widely accessible.</li>
                <li>130 mL water</li>
                <li>25 g granulated sugar about 2 tbsp</li>
                <li>potato starch or cornstarch</li>
                <li>150-180 g red bean paste</li>
                <li>6 strawberries cored</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Divide red bean paste into six equal portions and roll into balls. Each should be 25-30g each or about the size of a ping pong ball. Put in refrigerator while you assemble the mochi dough.</li>
            <li>In a microwave safe bowl, mix shiratamako, sugar, and water. Cover and microwave for 2 minutes, or until mochi dough is cooked through.</li>
            <li>While still hot, turn out mochi onto a surface dusted with starch. Divide into six equal parts. Roll each part into a flat circle, roughly 3-4" in diameter.</li>
            <li>Take one circle, keeping the rest of the mochi covered with a damp towel to keep it from drying out. Place a red bean paste ball in the center, and wrap the mochi around it, pinching the edges to seal into a ball. Roll daifuku in more starch to keep it from sticking.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the other five mochi circles and red bean paste balls.</li>
            <li>With kitchen scissors, snip the top of each daifuku. Press a cored strawberry into the opening of each daifuku, and you're done! Daifuku need to be eaten the day they are made.</li>
        </ol>
