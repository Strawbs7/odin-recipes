        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Matcha, also known as powdered green tea or green tea powder</li>
            <li>Hot water, about 176ºF or 80ºC</li>
            <li>Soy milk</li>
            <li>Sugar (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Sift the matcha powder into a bowl or cup. This will minimize any lumps and yield a smooth latte.</li>
            <li>Add the hot water to the bowl.</li>
            <li>Whisk briskly, drawing a letter W, not the usual circular pattern. Blend the hot water and matcha powder until no lumps remain. The matcha should be smooth and a little foamy.</li>
            <li>Steam the cold milk with a steaming wand or froth the warmed milk with a handheld milk frother.</li>
            <li>Pour the milk into the matcha. Sprinkle additional matcha on top.</li>
        </ol>
